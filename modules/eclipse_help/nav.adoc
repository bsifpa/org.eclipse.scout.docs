// TODO: Some of these files include files from elsewhere, with the
// wrong heading levels. This is why these files don't have a heading
// level of 0 (top level, "="). This in turn means that these files
// don't get a name assigned by Antora and that's why we have to
// provide those names, here. Or, alternatively, reorganise the Scout
// documentation.
