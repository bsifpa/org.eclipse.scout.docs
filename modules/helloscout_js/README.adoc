= Git Subtree

Updating the example based on xref:https://github.com/bsi-software/helloscoutjs/[helloscoutjs], the Scout JS Hello World application.
There's more info xref:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-subtree-merges[About Git subtree merges].

How it was added:

[listing]
git remote add -f helloscoutjs https://github.com/bsi-software/helloscoutjs.git
git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories helloscoutjs/releases/22.0
git read-tree --prefix=modules/helloscout_js/examples/ -u helloscoutjs/releases/22.0
git commit -m "Subtree merged in helloscoutjs"

How to pull upstream changes:

[listing]
git pull -s subtree helloscoutjs releases/22.0

Please don't edit the example directly. If you do, you can see who to extract the commits in order to contribute them back upstream in the xref:https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree[git subtree] blog post.
