= Git configuration

include::common:partial$Init.adoc[]

If you want to add the created application to a Git repository there might some configurations be helpful. If there are no plans to use Git, this chapter can be skipped.

E.g. it is best practice to exclude some files from adding to a Git repository. These exclusions can be configured by creating a file named `.gitignore` in the root folder of the repository (see the https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[Git Documentation] for details).
Here is a sample file that might be used as starting point:

....
# Git
*.orig

# Maven
target/
.surefire-*
.flattened-pom.xml

# Node
node_modules/
test-results/

# Do not check in any log files
*.log
....
