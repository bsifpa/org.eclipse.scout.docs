= Setting up the Initial Project

This section deals with setting up the initial workspace and code base for the "Contacts" application.

== Creating the initial Codebase

In case your workspace contains modules from the "`Hello World`" tutorial, you may want to multi-select them and to either close them by invoking the context menu "`Close Projects`" or to delete them by invoking the context menu "`Delete`".
The initial code for the "`Contacts`" application is then generated using the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard.
For the wizard fields you may use the values below and as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_tutorial>>

* [field]_Group Id_: `org.eclipse.scout`
* [field]_Artifact Id_: `contacts`
* [field]_Display Name_: "Contacts Application"

[[img-sdk_new_project_tutorial]]

To create this initial application click on btn:[Finish].
The project wizard then creates a number of Maven modules as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>>

== Removing unnecessary Components

We start with removing the `\*.helloworld` and `\*.settings` packages in all Maven modules of the "Contacts" application.
To delete packages, first select an individual package or packages in the Eclipse package explorer as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>> and then hit the kbd:[Delete] key.

The packages to delete is provided per Maven module in the list below.

Client Module `contacts.client`::
* In folder `src/main/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.settings`
* In folder `src/test/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld`

Server Module `contacts.server`::
* In folder `src/main/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld`
* In folder `src/test/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld`

Shared Module `contacts.shared`::
* In folder `src/main/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld`
* In folder `src/generated/java`
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld`

The deletion of these outlines results in a number of compile errors in classes `WorkOutline` and `Desktop`.
All these errors will be resolved in the following two sections where we modify the two classes to our needs.

== Changes to Class WorkOutline

Instead of adding a new "Contacts" outline to the application we reuse the generated code and rename the "Work" outline into "Contacts" outline.
For this, we perform the following modifications to class `WorkOutline`.

* Rename the class package to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact`
* Rename the class to `ContactOutline`
* Change the outline title to "Contacts"
* Change the outline icon to `Icons.Folder`

To quickly find class `WorkOutline` we first open the [wizard]_Open Type_ dialog from the Eclipse IDE by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T] and enter "workoutline" into the search field as shown in <<img-eclipse_open_type>>
In the result list, we select the desired class and click the btn:[OK] button to open the file `WorkOutline.java` in the Java editor of the Eclipse IDE.

[[img-eclipse_open_type]]
.Use the Open Type dialog to quickly find java types in the Eclipse IDE.

We start with the package rename.
To rename the package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.work` to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact` click into the word "work" of the package name and hit kbd:[Alt+Shift+R].
This opens the package rename dialog as shown in <<img-sdk_rename_package>> where we replace "work" by "contact" in the [element]_New name_ field.
After pressing the btn:[Ok] button Eclipse informs the programmer that the code modification may not be accurate as the resource has compile errors.
This warning can be acknowledged by clicking btn:[Continue].

[[img-sdk_rename_package]]
.Use the Eclipse Rename Package dialog to rename a Java package.
image::common:sdk_rename_package.png[]

In next step we rename class `WorkOutline` to `ContactOutline`.
In the Java editor we can rename the class by clicking into the class identifier `WorkOutline` and hitting kbd:[Alt+Shift+R].
Inside the edit box we can then change the class name to `ContactOutline` and hit the btn:[Enter] key to execute the change.
If Eclipse shows a Rename Type dialog just hit button btn:[Continue] to let Eclipse complete the rename operation.
To get rid of the compile error in method `execCreateChildPages` we simply delete the content in the method body.

Next, we change the outline title in method `getConfiguredTitle` by replacing the string "Work" with "Contacts", setting the cursor at the end of the word "Contacts" and hitting kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to open the Scout content assist as shown in <<img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact>>

[[img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact]]
.Use the Scout content assist to add new translations.
image::common:sdk_new_text_entry_contact.png[]

To enter a new translated text we double click on the proposal [element]_New text..._ to open the Scout new entry wizard as shown in <<img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard>>

[[img-sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard]]
.Use the Scout new entry wizard to add translated texts to the application.
image::common:sdk_new_text_entry_contact_wizard.png[]

As the last modification we change the return value of method `getConfiguredIconId` to value `Icons.Folder` and end with the code shown in <<lst-contacts_outline>>

To conclude the modifications we must get rid of the faulty import statement.
To do this we could in principle press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O] to organize the imports automatically.
However, we want to register the organization of imports as a so-called "`Save Action`".
This can be done in the Eclipse preferences.

Invoke the top-level menu "`Window/Preferences`" and enter "`Save Action`" as a filter text to narrow down the tree on the left side of the preferences window.
Then, chose the "`Java/Editor/Save Actions`" node and check the boxes "[x] Format Source Code" and "[x] Organize imports".
As you may have guessed, this formats the source code and organizes the import statements every time the user saves a Java class.

After having done so, perform a dummy modification in the class `ContactOutline` (e.g. add a space somewhere in the class body) and save the file.
As a consequence, the faulty import statement at the beginning of the class file should have vanished and the class should show no compile errors anymore.

== Changes to Class Desktop

The second class to adapt for the "Contacts" application is the `Desktop` class.
This class is implemented exactly once in each Scout application and holds the available outlines and top level menus of the application in the form of inner classes.

For the "Contacts" application we adapt the initial implementation to have outline view buttons for the "Contacts" and "Search" outlines.
The top level menus are then adapted to hold the menus "Quick Access", "Options" and a menu for the logged in user.

Start with opening the class in the Java editor using kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T] to quickly access the class.
In the source code of method `getConfiguredOutlines` remove `SettingsOutline.class` from the list of return values as shown in <<lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines>>

[[lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines]]
[source,java]
.Method getConfiguredOutlines defines the outlines associated with the desktop of the application.
----
include::common:example$contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/Desktop.java[tags=getConfiguredOutlines]
----

Then, perform the following changes in class `Desktop`

* Delete the inner class `SettingOutlineViewButton`
* Delete the inner class `UserProfileMenu`.
* Rename inner class WorkOutlineViewButton to `ContactOutlineViewButton`
* Create a new inner class called `QuickAccessMenu` after the `SearchOutlineViewButton`.
For this navigate the cursor after the `SearchOutlineViewButton` class, press kbd:[Ctrl+Space] and select the `Menu` entry.
Adapt the created code until it matches the template as shown in <<lst-contacts_desktop>>
Note that in your implementation, the menu should extend `AbstractMenu` instead of `AbstractFormMenu` in contrast to what is shown in <<lst-contacts_desktop>>
As a consequence, the method `getConfiguredForm` from <<lst-contacts_desktop>> is obsolete.
* Create another menu called `OptionsMenu` right after the newly created `QuickAccessMenu` according to <<lst-contacts_desktop>>
* Create a last menu called `UserMenu` after the `OptionsMenu` according to <<lst-contacts_desktop>>
* Delete the method `onThemeChanged`.
* Remove the statement in the body of the constructor.
* Note that it is not necessary to organize the imports since you have registered the organization of imports as a save action earlier in this tutorial.

At the end of these changes the inner class structure of class Desktop will look similar to the sample shown in <<lst-contacts_desktop>>

[[lst-contacts_desktop]]
[source,java]

----
include::common:example$contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/Desktop.java[tags=DesktopInit]
----

<1> In your implementation `OptionsMenu` should extend `AbstractMenu` and the method `getConfiguredForm` should be deleted.
<2> In your implementation `UserMenu` should extend `AbstractMenu` and the method `getConfiguredForm` should be deleted.

== What have we achieved?

In the first step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have created the initial project setup that will serve as the basis for all the following tutorial steps.

As the "Contacts" application is in a clean state you can now test the application using the following steps.
The user interface of the application will now look as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1>>

* Activate the launch group _[webapp] all_ to start the JS build, the frontend and the backend
* Open address http://localhost:8082/[http://localhost:8082/] in your browser

[[img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1]]

From the coding perspective we now have all necessary maven Modules for the "Contacts" application including Java package and class names to match with the complete Scout "Contacts" demo application.
This point is important as it simplifies the comparison of intermediate stages of the tutorial application with the Scout demo application.
The same is true for the user perspective: The layout of the current state of the tutorial matches with the complete "Contacts" sample application.
